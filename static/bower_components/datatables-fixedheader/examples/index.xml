At times it can be useful to ensure that column titles will remain always visible on a table, even when a user scrolls down a table. The FixedHeader plug-in for DataTables will float the `dt-tag thead` element above the table at all times to help address this issue. The column titles also remain click-able to perform sorting. Key features include:

* Fix the header to the top of the window
* Ability to fix the footer and left / right columns as well
* z-Index ordering options
